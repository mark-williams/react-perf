#React Performance
Small project to investigate performance in React.

###Application
I wanted to explore a reasonably large set of arbitary data, so came up with this fairly pointless application! It picks lottery numbers on a timer, showing the pool from which it picks and displaying the chosen selection at the top and by highlighting the chsoen items in the pool.

So I could quickly change the amount of items in the pool I have created a Redux action which initialises the pool (if this was reasonably static I cvould have done this as an initial state in the Redux store).
